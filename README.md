Guardians of Sustainability 🌍

is an AI-powered urban infrastructure monitoring system designed to promote sustainable city management in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). By leveraging computer vision and real-time data analysis, the project provides a scalable solution to assist government agencies in identifying and prioritizing infrastructure issues across urban environments.


This project was developed as part of the **Sharjah Sustainability Award** initiative, with a focus on addressing critical sustainability challenges using modern technologies.



🌿 Project Objective

Urban infrastructure is subject to constant wear due to environmental factors and daily usage. Issues such as broken street signs, fallen trees, and damaged sidewalks can pose safety risks and negatively impact quality of life. Unfortunately, many of these issues go unreported or are identified too late.

Guardians of Sustainability aims to automate the detection, classification, and geo-reporting of these issues through the use of artificial intelligence, enabling quicker response times and more informed maintenance planning.


🛰️ System Architecture & Workflow

- Government-owned public vehicles (e.g., taxis, buses) are equipped with cameras that capture **images every 5 seconds** while in operation.
- The images are analyzed by an integrated **AI model**, which classifies the level of urgency or attention required: **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**.
- A daily report is automatically generated, containing:
  - Annotated images
  - Issue classification and priority level
  - Precise GPS location
  - A clickable Google Maps link for on-site navigation

This system reduces the reliance on manual reporting and supports proactive maintenance of urban areas.
